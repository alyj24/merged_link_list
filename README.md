Lab Problem: Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
```

Description: We are given two linked lists, each representing a non-decreasingly sorted sequence of integers. The task is to merge these two linked lists into a single, sorted linked list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Input:
: the first linked list. list2: the second linked list. Each linked list node contains an integer value and a reference to the next node.
Output:
A single linked list that is the result of merging list1 and list2, sorted in non-decreasing order.
Constraints:
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.value <= 100

```
Example:
Input:
list1: 1->2->4
list2: 1-3 -> 4
Output:
Merged List: 11→2→3→4->4
```

# About The Program
```
Linked lists offer some important advantages over other linear data structures. Unlike arrays, they are a dynamic data structure, resizable at run-time. Also, the insertion and deletion operations are efficient and easily implemented.
